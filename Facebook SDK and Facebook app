Android app with Facebook SDK wont login, if user already has Facebook app installed. 

The "Key Hash" generated in the Unity Engine is wrong. So to generate right one you need to do next steps:

1. Unzip .apk file and extract META-INF\CERT.RSA file
2. in command line run: keytool -printcert -file CERT.RSA
3. notice SHA1 bytes are printed like 29:37:F1:CB:06â€¦
4. copy SHA1 bytes into HEX to BASE64 converter (http://tomeko.net/online_tools/hex_to_base64.php)
5. see your BASE64 key hash in output field
