									Entitlement Check DOES NOT work in EDITOR!!! 
						You MUST UPLOAD BUILD to oculus dasboard TO TEST out Entitlement Check

Link: https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/platform/1.7/concepts/pgsg-3-pw-platform-walkthrough/

Script part is very simple:  
(you can find other implementation methods, this from the article above)
      Core.Initialize("123456789012345");
      Entitlements.IsUserEntitledToApplication().OnComplete(
        (Message msg) =>
        {
          if (msg.IsError)
          {
            // User is NOT entitled.
            showMessageThatTheUserDoesntOwnThis();
          } else 
          {
           // User IS entitled
           proceedAsNormal();
          }
        }
      );   

But its hard to figure out that Entitlement Check doesnt work in editor and requires build to be uploaded to oculus ALPHA RELEASE CHANNEL.
Dont forget to add test users to this Release Channel!
